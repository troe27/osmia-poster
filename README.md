Haplodiploid sex determination systems are found in all species of Hymenoptera. However, the molecular genetic mechanisms that specify sex are highly diverse and have only been discovered in a small number of species. In many haplodiploid taxa, the initial trigger is a complementary sex determination (CSD) locus, in which heterozygosity initiates a molecular pathway to generate females. In the honeybee Apis mellifera, the CSD locus overlaps an exon of a protein-coding gene and affects its amino acid sequence whereas in the ant Linepithema humile it affects expression of the lncRNA gene ANTSR. Here, we map a single CSD locus in the genome of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. The region is orthologous to the CSD locus identified in L. humile. We identify elevated levels of genetic diversity in the ortholog of the locus in other bee genera, suggesting that it may govern sex determination widely in bees.
